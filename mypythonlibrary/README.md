The software tracks the limit cycle oscillations of arbitrary ordinary differential equations 
(ODEs) and the steady-states of second-order diffusive parabolic diffusive equations (PDEs).

The modules that are required for using and implementing the library are:
    -math
    -matplotlib
    -scipy
    -numpy

The structure of the software consists of a library containing the main functions myfunctions.py.
There is a test script, test_myfunctions.py, which contains specific tests for certain applications
of the funtions. The main.py file contains examples of how the library can be implemented.
All other files can be ignored for the assessment of this unit. They mainly consist of jupyter notebook
files that were used for experimentation purposes.
